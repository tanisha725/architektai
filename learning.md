# Learning Log — ArchitektAI

Running record of concepts learned while building this project, in the order we hit them.
Each entry: **what it is**, **why we needed it here**, **key takeaway**.

## Phase 0 — Planning & Architecture Decisions

### Why we're keeping our own app simple
- **What**: We deliberately chose a single Next.js app + single PostgreSQL database instead of microservices, Redis, Kafka, Kubernetes, etc.
- **Why here**: None of those technologies solve a problem our app actually has (our traffic, our data shape, our background-job needs don't justify them). Adding them anyway would be resume-padding, not engineering.
- **Takeaway**: A senior engineering signal is choosing the *simplest system that satisfies the requirements*, then being able to explain exactly what would force you to add complexity later. This is also literally what the app teaches users to do for the systems *they* design — "architecture evolution" (Phase 15).

### The distinction between "the system we build" vs. "the systems our system can design"
- **What**: Our app itself stays simple (Next.js + Postgres). But it must be able to *reason about and explain* complex architectures (Kafka, sharded databases, CDNs, etc.) for the designs it generates.
- **Why here**: This shapes the knowledge base and prompt design — the AI needs facts about many technologies without our infrastructure needing to use them.
- **Takeaway**: A tool that designs systems doesn't need to be built out of every system it can describe.

### Why AI output must be schema-constrained (preview — full lesson in Phase 6)
- **What**: Instead of letting the LLM return free-form text, we define Zod/TypeScript schemas (e.g., `SystemDesign`) and validate every AI response against them before rendering.
- **Why here**: Free-form LLM text is unpredictable in structure — it can't be reliably rendered into UI components, diagrams, or stored in a database. An unvalidated response can also silently be wrong in a way that just looks like normal prose.
- **Takeaway**: Structured output turns "hope the AI formats it right" into "the AI's response either matches the contract or we catch it and handle the error" — this is the difference between a demo and a product.

## How to use this file
- We add an entry **after** each concept is introduced and you've had the checkpoint questions, not before — so this reflects what you've actually learned, not just what was planned.
- Entries stay even if we later change the implementation — this is a *learning* record, not a design doc (that's what the README and code comments are for).
